##  Vision Transformer Architecture (Custom)

This project implements a **custom Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture** for object detection. Instead of traditional CNNs, ViTs use **self-attention mechanisms** to analyze image patches and extract meaningful features.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Components:

- **Patch Embedding**: Splits an input image into fixed-size patches and converts them into embeddings.
- **Positional Encoding**: Adds spatial information to the patch embeddings.
- **Transformer Encoder**: Applies multi-head self-attention and feed-forward layers.
- **Classification & Object Detection Heads**: Outputs class probabilities and bounding boxes.

## Â Pretrained DeiT Base Weights

We leverage the **DeiT (Data-efficient Image Transformer) Base model**, which is trained on ImageNet using knowledge distillation. This improves:

- **Training efficiency** with fewer data samples.
- **Robust feature extraction** for object detection tasks.
- **Better generalization** across different image datasets.

## Interactive Interface for Object Detection

This repository includes a **user-friendly interactive interface** for detecting objects from images. The interface allows users to:

- **Upload an image** ðŸ“¤
- **Click on upload and predict**
- **Object will be predicted**



### ðŸ”¹ How to Use:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vision-transformer-object-detection.git
   cd vision-transformer-object-detection
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
